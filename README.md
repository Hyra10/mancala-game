# Mancala Game

This is a small project trying to create a ReactJS mancala game
the UI is not good and it needs lots of love
the two players should use the same mouse/trackpad since there is no api conection, or socket to comunicate between computers, it doesn't have AI for the second player, it is just a simple React JS mancala game.
